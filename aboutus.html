         <p>We have always had a dream of opening up our own local flower shop. 
           Not just your typical shop, but a class drive through flower shop that 
           provides uniquely out together bouquets. Though we only offer 5 arrangement 
           options to choose from per day, we promise you will find one that meets your 
           need. whatever the situation is. 
          </p>

        <h2>Kristine Smith: Hello All!! I'm a local Louisvillian as well. I love this beautiful city
          and enjoy exploring it with my lovely daughter and husband.
        </h2>
          <p>Paige and i have been friends since 6th grade. We got pregnant at the same time, 
            so our kiddos are the same age. I have always enjoyed putting together flower arrangements for friends.
            We both have passions to be florist and decided to take the leap and start Flowers De Lou.
            We are looking forward to our shop being a staple in Louisville for years to come.
